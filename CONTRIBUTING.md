Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FOLIO reporting.  We
appreciate submissions of SQL code for new report queries and derived
table queries, as well as bug fixes.  Please follow these guidelines
when preparing a pull request.

1\. New contributors
--------------------

Before working on a contribution, it is usually a good idea to ask the
community in advance about the work you propose to do.  They may have
feedback that would save you time.

For general questions, please use the
[Discussions](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/discussions)
area.

For bugs or specific technical proposals, please use
[Issues](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/issues).


2\. Branches
------------

Pull requests should be based on:

* `main` for all new features as well as bug fixes to unreleased
  features

* `release-*` for bug fixes to specific releases


3\. Code review
---------------

A pull request is reviewed by at least one person other than the
contributor before it can be merged.


4\. Documentation
-----------------

Additions or changes to queries should be accompanied by the
corresponding additions or changes to user documentation, together in
the same pull request.


5\. Testing
-----------

All queries or changes to queries should be tested with an LDP
database before they are submitted in a pull request.  We do not
currently have a test data set to allow significant automated testing.


6\. Derived tables
------------------

Additions or changes to derived tables should be accompanied by any
required additions or changes to the `runlist.txt` and `deps.txt`
files, together in the same pull request.


7\. Formatting SQL
------------------

We use the `pg_format` tool from
[pgFormatter](https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter) to make SQL code
more readable.  For maximum consistency, a [configuration
file](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/blob/main/sql/pg_format.conf)
has been provided.

Please use this method to format submitted code if possible.

Note that `pg_format` has known issues such as with [formatting
CTEs](https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter/issues/213).  In these
cases, manual formatting is preferred.
